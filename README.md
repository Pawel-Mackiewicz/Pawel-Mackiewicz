> My brain is wired for puzzles. A gnarly bug, a tricky Sudoku, or a complex system design—I'm the person who gets a kick out of solving them. I've been turning that obsession into robust Java applications since I first compiled `Hello, World!` at 12.

I believe that while LLMs are great for boilerplate, they can't beat a human developer when it comes to crafting **solid, high-quality architecture**. That's my sweet spot.

### 🏆 My Main Quest: BankApp

This is my pride and joy. What began as a "let's see what happens" multithreading experiment evolved into a full-blown, cloud-deployed banking application. It's proof that a solid foundation and a bit of obsession can go a long way.

### 🔋 When I'm Not Coding...

I'm probably recharging my own batteries. You can find me:
-   ⛰️ Conquering a mountain trail
-   🛶 Paddling down a river
-   🥋 Tangling with people in pajamas (BJJ)
-   🧘 Finding my inner zen with yoga

...and yes, there's always a Sudoku puzzle within arm's reach.
